								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Havana, ooh na-na (ay)<br />
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (ay, ay)<br />
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na<br />
Oh, but my heart is in Havana (ay)<br />
There&#8217;s somethin&#8217; &#8217;bout his manners (uh huh)<br />
Havana, ooh na-na (uh)</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t walk up with that &#8220;how you doin&#8217;?&#8221; (uh)<br />
(When he came in the room)<br />
He said there&#8217;s a lot of girls I can do with (uh)<br />
(But I can&#8217;t without you)<br />
I knew him forever in a minute (hey)<br />
(That summer night in June)<br />
And papa says he got malo in him (uh)<br />
He got me feelin&#8217; like</p>
<p>Ooh-ooh-ooh, I knew it when I met him<br />
I loved him when I left him<br />
Got me feelin&#8217; like<br />
Ooh-ooh-ooh, and then I had to tell him<br />
I had to go, oh na-na-na-na-na</p>
<p>Havana, ooh na-na (ay, ay)<br />
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (ay, ay)<br />
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na (uh huh)<br />
Oh, but my heart is in Havana (ay)<br />
My heart is in Havana (ay)<br />
Havana, ooh na-na</p>
